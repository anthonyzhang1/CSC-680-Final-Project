## Proposal
The application I am making, Benkyou Nakama, is a flashcard app that uses spaced repetition. It is inspired by the already existing Anki flashcard app which costs $25 on the App Store.\
Spaced repetition is a technique where incorrectly answered flashcards are shown more frequently, whereas correctly answered flashcards are shown less frequently.

### Must Have Features
1.1. The user shall be able to create a flashcard deck.\
1.2. The user shall be able to delete a flashcard deck.\
1.3. The user shall be able to create a flashcard.\
1.4. The user shall be able to delete a flashcard.\
1.5. The user shall be able to create basic flashcards. They simply show the question and ask the user whether they were correct or not.\
1.6. The user shall be able to create true/false flashcards. They have true or false as an option, and only one of those options is correct.\
1.7. The user shall be able to create multiple choice flashcards. They have multiple options, and only one of these options is correct.

### Nice to Have Features
2.1. The user shall be able to edit a flashcard deck's name.\
2.2. The user shall be able to edit a flashcard.\
2.3. The user shall be able to search for a flashcard.\
2.4. The user shall be able to export their flashcard decks so that they can share them with others.\
2.5. The user shall be able to import flashcard decks so that they can download decks from others.\
2.6. The user shall be able to create cloze flashcards. They present the user with a phrase that has a section blanked out that the user must fill in. Correctly filling in the blank leads to the correct answer.

## Basic Wireframes
The first screen the user sees: a screen with all of their decks in it:

![your decks](https://github.com/anthonyzhang1/CSC-680-Final-Project/blob/main/.github/M1%20Basic%20Wireframes/Your%20Decks.png)

The screen showing a flashcard's prompt/question:

![flashcard prompt](https://github.com/anthonyzhang1/CSC-680-Final-Project/blob/main/.github/M1%20Basic%20Wireframes/Flashcard%20Question.png)

The screen showing a flashcard's prompt/question as well as the solution to the card. The user selects the difficulty they had with the card, which determines whether to decrease or increase the delay until the same card is shown again:
